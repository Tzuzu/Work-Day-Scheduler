## Purpose

The purpose of this website is to allow the user to save their daily schedule on a webpage, and it will store their data for the day without being erased upon refresh. It will highlight each hour depending on whether it is the current hour, whether it is in the future, or whether it is in the past.

## What I've Learned

I've learned that there is a lot you can do using bootstrap and referencing other js. Being able to pull the current time in the user's timezone and display it however you want is very convenient and is something that I can actually implement. 

- There was one issue in which my time would load after a second had passed, but due to learning that, I discovered that I had to run a function before the countdown starts, otherwise my site would be on a one second delay

- Bootstrap is very convenient and will make designing and building websites in the future much easier.
